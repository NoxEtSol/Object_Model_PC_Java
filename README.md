# Object_Model_PC_Java

### Design and implement an object model to describe the hardware computer.

The computer is modular and its various components can be replaced.
Such replaceable components are: microprocessor, memory and
various expansion cards (e.g. sound, security, graphics). 
Different memories have different sizes and speeds; 
different microprocessors are from different manufacturers and have different clock frequencies. 
When trying to insert memory with different speed an exception is thrown. 
The computer can have at once more memory modules (fixed number).

The program must make it possible to define different configurations of computer and have the possibility to display these configurations descriptively.
