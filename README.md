# Object_Model_PC_Java

### Design and implement an object model to describe the hardware computer.

The computer is modular and its various components can be replaced. <br>
Such replaceable components are: microprocessor, memory and
various expansion cards (e.g. sound, security, graphics). <br>
Different memories have different sizes and speeds; <br>
different microprocessors are from different manufacturers and have different clock frequencies. <br>
When trying to insert memory with different speed an exception is thrown. <br>
The computer can have at once more memory modules (fixed number).<br>
<br>
The program must make it possible to define different configurations of computer and have the possibility to display these configurations descriptively.
